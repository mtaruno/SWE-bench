      "@karlwessel , are you interested in submitting a patch for this? ðŸ˜¸ \n",
      "In principle yes, but at the moment I really can't say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which places would this affect? Only all calls to `all_*` in `wcsapi/fitswcs.py`?\n",
      "Yes I think that's right\n",
      "For what it is worth, my comment is about the issues with the example. I think so far the history of `all_pix2world` shows that it is a very stable algorithm that converges for all \"real\" astronomical images. So, I wanted to learn about this failure. [NOTE: This does not mean that you should not catch exceptions in `pixel_to_world()` if you wish so.]\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several issues with the example:\n",
      "1. Because `CTYPE` is not set, essentially the projection algorithm is linear, that is, intermediate physical coordinates are the world coordinates.\n",
      "2. SIP standard assumes that polynomials share the same CRPIX with the WCS. Here, CRPIX of the `Wcsprm` is `[0, 0]` while the CRPIX of the SIP is set to `[1221.87375165,  994.90917378]`\n",
      "3. If you run `wcs.all_pix2world(1, 1, 1)` you will get `[421.5126801, 374.13077558]` for world coordinates (and at CRPIX you will get CRVAL which is 0). This is in degrees. You can see that from the center pixel (CRPIX) to the corner of the image you are circling the celestial sphere many times (well, at least once; I did not check the other corners).\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, yes `all_world2pix` can fail but it does not imply that there is a bug in it. This example simply contains large distortions (like mapping `(1, 1) -> [421, 374]`) that cannot be handled with the currently implemented algorithm but I am not sure there is another algorithm that could do better.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to throwing or not an exception... that's tough. On one hand, for those who are interested in correctness of the values, it is better to know that the algorithm failed and one cannot trust returned values. For plotting, this may be an issue and one would prefer to just get, maybe, the linear approximation. My personal preference is for exceptions because they can be caught and dealt with by the caller.\n",
      "The example is a minimal version of our real WCS whichs nonlinear distortion is taken from a checkerboard image and it fits it quit well:\n",
      "![fitteddistortion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64231/116892995-be892a00-ac30-11eb-826f-99e3635af1fa.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "The WCS was fitted with `fit_wcs_from_points` using an artificial very small 'RA/DEC-TAN' grid so that it is almost linear.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess the Problem is that the camera really has a huge distortion which just isn't fitable with a polynomial. Nevertheless it still is a real camera distortion, but I agree in that it probably is not worth to be considered a bug in the `all_world2pix` method.\n",

      "\n",
      "Which places would this affect? Only all calls to `all_*` in `wcsapi/fitswcs.py`?\n",
      "Yes I think that's right\n",
      "For what it is worth, my comment is about the issues with the example. I think so far the history of `all_pix2world` shows that it is a very stable algorithm that converges for all \"real\" astronomical images. So, I wanted to learn about this failure. [NOTE: This does not mean that you should not catch exceptions in `pixel_to_world()` if you wish so.]\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several issues with the example:\n",
      "1. Because `CTYPE` is not set, essentially the projection algorithm is linear, that is, intermediate physical coordinates are the world coordinates.\n",
      "2. SIP standard assumes that polynomials share the same CRPIX with the WCS. Here, CRPIX of the `Wcsprm` is `[0, 0]` while the CRPIX of the SIP is set to `[1221.87375165,  994.90917378]`\n",
      "3. If you run `wcs.all_pix2world(1, 1, 1)` you will get `[421.5126801, 374.13077558]` for world coordinates (and at CRPIX you will get CRVAL which is 0). This is in degrees. You can see that from the center pixel (CRPIX) to the corner of the image you are circling the celestial sphere many times (well, at least once; I did not check the other corners).\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, yes `all_world2pix` can fail but it does not imply that there is a bug in it. This example simply contains large distortions (like mapping `(1, 1) -> [421, 374]`) that cannot be handled with the currently implemented algorithm but I am not sure there is another algorithm that could do better.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to throwing or not an exception... that's tough. On one hand, for those who are interested in correctness of the values, it is better to know that the algorithm failed and one cannot trust returned values. For plotting, this may be an issue and one would prefer to just get, maybe, the linear approximation. My personal preference is for exceptions because they can be caught and dealt with by the caller.\n",
      "The example is a minimal version of our real WCS whichs nonlinear distortion is taken from a checkerboard image and it fits it quit well:\n",
      "![fitteddistortion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64231/116892995-be892a00-ac30-11eb-826f-99e3635af1fa.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "The WCS was fitted with `fit_wcs_from_points` using an artificial very small 'RA/DEC-TAN' grid so that it is almost linear.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess the Problem is that the camera really has a huge distortion which just isn't fitable with a polynomial. Nevertheless it still is a real camera distortion, but I agree in that it probably is not worth to be considered a bug in the `all_world2pix` method.\n"
